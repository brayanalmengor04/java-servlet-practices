## Introduction
Java Servlets are Java programs that run on a web server, handling requests and generating dynamic content. This repository aims to provide hands-on examples to help you understand and utilize Java Servlets effectively in your web projects.

## Setup
To run the exercises in this repository, you'll need the following:
- JDK 8 or higher
- Apache Tomcat or any other servlet container
- Your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)

## Exercises

### HelloServlet
A simple servlet that responds with a "Hello, World!" message. This exercise introduces the basic structure and lifecycle of a servlet.

### FormHandlingServlet
This servlet demonstrates how to handle form data submitted via HTTP POST requests. You'll learn how to read request parameters and generate appropriate responses.

### SessionManagementServlet
Learn about session management in servlets, including how to create, manage, and invalidate sessions. This exercise covers essential concepts for maintaining user state across multiple requests.

### DatabaseIntegrationServlet
Integrate your servlet with a database using JDBC. This exercise shows you how to connect to a database, execute queries, and display results in your servlet's response.
